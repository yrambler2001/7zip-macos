// SZBenchmark.h -- the engine benchmark (CPP/7zip/UI/Common/Bench.{h,cpp}) behind a
// delegate-driven Objective-C object, plus the CPU / OS / memory strings the Benchmark
// dialog shows.
//
// 7zFM spawns `7zG b` for Tools > Benchmark; the macOS port runs it in-process
// (01-fm-feature-inventory.md 2.5, 8.1, 9 #1). SZBenchmark owns the worker thread and is
// the exact equivalent of BenchmarkDialog.cpp's CThreadBenchmark + CBenchProgressSync:
// one Bench() call per pass, results pushed to the delegate as they arrive.
//
// Parity: 01b-fm-dialogs-settings.md 4.26; 02-engine-api.md 2.3 (Bench.h), 4.4.
