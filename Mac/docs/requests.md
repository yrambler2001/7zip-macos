# Cross-scope requests

Requests one scope makes of another. The orchestrator assigns each to the owning scope's next
agent. Add a line, never rewrite someone else's.

| From | To | Request | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| `harness` | `options` (`Settings.swift`) and `opsinfra`/bridge owner (`SZSettings.mm`) | Let the app read its preferences domain from the `SEVENZIP_DEFAULTS_SUITE` environment variable so UI tests get a per-run isolated settings domain instead of writing to `com.yrambler2001.7zip`. | open |
| `harness` | `harness` (itself, next run) | `SevenZipApp.launch()` must terminate an already-running 7-Zip instance first; a sibling agent's running app broke two UI runs. | open |
| `fsfolder` | `panel` | `GetSystemIconIndex` and the delete-confirmation strings were left to the panel scope. | open |
